# Dependency Inversion Principle

Dependency inversion is a very powerful principle which allows us to model dependency direction the way we want, 
and not the way the call flows.

With the help of dependency inversion we can protect high level policy and invert the dependency wherein low level
component depends upon high level policy and not the other way. 

You can also use as plugin architecture, where you can plug in a low level dependency without changing high level 
component.
